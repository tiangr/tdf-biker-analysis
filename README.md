This project analyzes the complete Tour de France dataset to explore the greatest cyclists in the history of the event using network analysis techniques, specifically PageRank.

## TODO's
- [x] Scraping tables from ProCyclingStats
- [🛠️] Correct scraped data
- [🛠️] Construct various MultiDiGraphs:
    - [ ] With no weights
    - [ ] Weights are time differences
    - [ ] Weights are normalized time differences
    - [ ] Weights are normalized time differences scaled by type of stage & stage length
    - [ ] Weights are points obtained after stage
- [🛠️] Create a table of data, from which we can perform basic statistics to evaluate the best riders based on number of stage wins, overall wins, etc.
- [ ] Perform statistics
- [ ] Write a report
